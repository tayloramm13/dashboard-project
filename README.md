Planning Step 2:
*Take things one section at a time*

1. Begin to nest child elements under parent elements in HTML 
    - *REMEMBER* you may keep making grid containers within containers
2. In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out navigation and branding section
3. In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons
4. For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items
5. Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all grid items
